Fusebox is open in the first floor mechanical room, just needs the fuse from the workshop to get it running at full efficiency. Without it, we’re running around 80% of the oxygen levels we should.\n\n- Cory"

Still waiting on you for the caps and the actual explosives though. I think Geraldine’s got the explosive components in the chem lab, but Gideon said you’ve got the caps in your locker. Hurry up and get them to me - we need to get this done by end of next week.\n\nThanks,\nCory Kuhn"

Basically, you need three things - some type of explosive material, something to trigger it, and something to set it off while you’re far enough away to not get hit by debris. Good news is we’ve got the stuff lying around the structure. Bad news is the matron’s been getting on me about \"not sending sensitive information over email,\" but I’m also \"not supposed to write stuff down.\"\n\nAnyway, I left you more detailed instructions in that book about the \"let them eat cake\" lady that we’re \"reading\" for book club.\n\n- Spence"

Obviously, Tombstone is getting older, but still very competitive, and I thought he was on target for winning when out of nowhere they called the fight for Bombshell!  What the…..??!!  How could they possibly make this kind of error?  There’s no way Tombstone was disqualified. If anything, I’d say Bombshell was!  Am I nuts, or did you see  this, too?   Seriously, man, I think it’s time for me to take my robot into competition.  They need some new blood.  But I don’t know if I can trust the judging.\nSo, if I start competing, you think TimeLabs would sponsor me?\n\nShemar"

I realize now that my words may have come across that way, and for that, I am truly sorry. It was not my intention to insult or undermine you in any way. I respect your work and contributions to our team greatly.\n\nI believe that open and honest communication is key to resolving conflicts and moving forward. If you have time, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further and understand your perspective better. Please let me know when you might be available for a brief chat.\n\nThank you for considering this, and I hope we can find a way to resolve this and work together harmoniously.\n\nBest regards,\nAnnalise"
